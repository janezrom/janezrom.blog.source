# Bash oneliner: watch a filesize

Sometimes, when running a long operation modifying a single file, I want to monitor its progress by watching that file’s size increase. Here’s a simple one-liner which will print the incrementing filesize until Ctrl-C is pressed:

    while true; do echo -e -n "\r`ls -l -h FILENAME | awk '{ print $5 }'`"; done

# Network trafic

    pacman -S lshw iftop

    lshw -class network
    sudo iftop -i wlp3s0 -B

# Watch file size

    while true; do echo -e -n “ls -l -h FILENAME | awk '{ print $5 }'”; done
